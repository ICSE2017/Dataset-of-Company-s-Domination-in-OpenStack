The fact that I\n    had glance-api and glance-registry installed on my local machine\n    was causing the test runs to improperly return a passing result.\n    \n    It just so happens that the glance-api and glance-registry that\n    I had installed to my /usr/local/bin were the very same programs\n    that were from a previous branch I had locally where I fixed the\n    root cause of this issue, which was that the sqlalchemy @validates\n    decorator does NOT fire for *new* objects, only existing ones, which\n    resulted in image_create() improperly storing NULL data in type, name,\n    and other non-nullable fields in the database. This then set off\n    a domino effect which caused the next call from\n    glance.server._upload_and_activate() to die a horrible death due to\n    the @validates decorator then firing on the already-created Image\n    object.

I place the values that were in the type column into the image_properties\n    table as records with a key column values of \'type\'. The test case verifies\n    that on upgrade from v2 to v3, the type column values are preserved as\n    image properties, and on downgrade from v3 to v2, the type properties\n    are re-inserted into the images.type column.\n    \n    Phew.\n',499,24,'Rackspace'),(250542,194,194,'2011-03-23 10:49:20','2011-03-23 10:49:20','    Fixed an oops.

There are a few bugs that\n    reference fragile tests.

The socket is opened in the test code but not closed. Then\n    the service process (api or registry) is forked off where it inherits\n    the open file descriptor.

Without the _() builtin installed, importing\n    some modules like glance.common.exception will fail.\n    \n    Since it only ever makes sense to load tests from the glance/tests dir,\n    we can ask nose to do that by using the --tests argument via setup.cfg.\n    \n    Note, this means that if you previously did this:\n    \n      $> tox -- glance.tests.foo glance.tests.bar\n    \n    then you must now do this:\n    \n      $> tox -- --tests glance.tests.foo,glance.tests.bar\n    \n    Change-Id: If4125d6bcbde63df95de129ac5c83b4a6d6f130a\n',1,4,'Red Hat'),(252856,3576,3576,'2013-05-22 12:13:44','2013-05-07 17:17:30','    Add unittests for image upload functionality in v1\n    \n    This patch adds unittests for the code that handles uploading image data to the\n    image store in v1 of the api. upload_utils.py was created in order to make this\n    area of code more testable and move upload logic out of the images api\n    controller.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1177999\n    \n    Change-Id: I97f0fa052e65228abb50090af812c3ebec605744\n',479,125,'Rackspace'),(252858,3669,3669,'2013-05-20 17:31:22','2013-03-07 16:11:57','    Improve unit tests for glance.common package\n    \n    Add tests for next modules:\n    * glance.common.wsgi\n    * glance.common.utils\n    * glance.common.client\n    * glance.common.config\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1152183\n    Change-Id: Iedbdfb6af411170da10d078e48f5098f8d1c668b\n',645,481,'Grid Dynamics'),(252860,28,28,'2013-05-08 09:23:32','2013-04-10 12:12:03','    Add GLANCE_LOCALEDIR env variable\n    \n    Part of fixing bug #995287\n    \n    Syncs these two commits from oslo-incubator:\n    \n      Support overriding oslo localedir too\n      Add a gettextutils.install() helper function\n    \n    to get a new gettextutils.install() function which allows the default\n    localedir to be overwritten via an environment variable.\n    \n    Note that gettextutils.install() must be called before any other glance\n    modules are imported since some modules attempt to translate strings\n    at import time (e.g. the help strings for config options in config.py).\n    This is broken and inefficient, but fixing it involves adding something\n    like spinx\'s l_() function and would be very invaisve.\n    \n    Also, note that calling gettextutils.install() in glance.cmd.__init__\n    means that no program which uses a different translation domain should\n    ever import any of the modules under glance.cmd.\n    \n    Change-Id: I86562b3a65d371673bb21f7179eecc7602bc0775\n',23,34,'Red Hat'),(252862,3576,3576,'2013-05-22 12:51:29','2013-05-10 12:15:15','    Respond with 412 after upload if image was deleted.\n    \n    When updating the image after upload, we should return an\n    HTTPPreconditionFailed instead of a 500 error if the image cannot\n    be found.\n    \n    This will also provide more information to nova when this occurs\n    during snapshotting.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1176174\n    \n    Change-Id: I270ee129470323dae3919ed0a8c335eae7c24061\n',47,3,'Rackspace'),(252864,1699,1699,'2013-05-17 16:07:41','2013-05-13 19:14:29','    rbd: return image size when asked\n    \n    Implement get_size(), and use it for the second part of the return\n    value of get().\n    \n    Convert the old-style functional tests into tests using the store test\n    base class.

Note that there may be false\n    positives since some stores may not require any configuration parameter.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie784fe90003a5064aaf16fadb7266bf7a46e2cf5\n    Closes-Bug: #1290969\n',22,4,'Red Hat'),(253847,2671,2671,'2014-03-11 16:39:05','2014-03-04 15:37:26','    API v2: Allow GET on unowned images with show_image_direct_url\n    \n    This fixes an issue where copy.deepcopy was being a called\n    on an ImmutableLocations object, causing a Forbidden to be\n    raised.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia7ac121478cf63d68bd5a3d91faa51a42afeb2fe\n    Closes-Bug: 1287888\n',17,2,'NetApp'),(253849,4796,4796,'2014-03-01 11:47:21','2014-03-01 09:45:16','    Include Location header in POST /tasks response\n    \n    In addition to returning a 201, a successful POST to /tasks\n    should include a Location header with the direct path to the\n    newly created resource.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1287760\n    \n    Change-Id: I11001e1d6bb5168f0ee80c3d81574e59ddd47147\n',13,1,'Rackspace'),(253851,4836,4836,'2014-02-28 11:28:17','2014-02-28 11:23:30','    Catch exception when image cache pruning\n    \n    If a cached image file does not exist, os.stat will throw an exception\n    and the glance-cache-pruner can fail to run when it encounters\n    the non-existent file.\n    \n    Adds a catch for the possible exception and sets file size to 0 so\n    the glance-cache-pruner can successfully run and prune the cache.\n    \n    Change-Id: I55bee82c4a7aa0393d36c603c91adb8b44a7c7a3\n    Fixes: bug #1286240\n',6,2,'independent'),(253853,5335,5335,'2014-03-05 16:50:53','2014-03-03 17:49:15','    Fix glance db migration failed on 031\n    \n    In fact, the first where expression has filtered the duplicated locations,\n    and the second filters the locations which have more than 1 rows, so the\n    second result set is included in the first.\n    In DB2, if the boolean of where expression is true, it will throw error.\n    So remove the second where expression to fix glance db migration failed on 031.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1287087\n    \n    Change-Id: Id485b6d20696e989d10f3759011387137543918a\n',0,5,'IBM'),(253855,1714,1714,'2014-03-14 13:12:04','2014-03-12 13:51:56','    Makes possible to enable Registry API v1 and v2\n    \n    This change will make possible to enable/disable both v1 and v2 Registry APIs\n    either individually or together from glance-registry.conf.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes bug: #1290432\n    Change-Id: Ib2458b3312bdb552975b1e42485086a1c3aa6d3f\n',82,16,'HP'),(253856,818,818,'2014-03-14 15:42:28','2014-03-12 15:18:48','    Make the VMware datastore backend more robust\n    \n    This patch contains several fixes related to invalid configurations\n    and corner cases:\n    - better error handling for the store operations\n    - better logging when response is not successful\n    - better support for various store_image_dir formats\n    \n    Change-Id: I6c0003e29d621c1f71490cb9fce163dc840a113f\n    Closes-Bug: #1291646\n',55,21,'VMware'),(253857,2120,2120,'2014-03-11 14:15:33','2014-03-11 14:15:33','    Add copyright text to glance/openstack/common/__init__.py\n    \n    Synchronize the content of glance/openstack/common/__init__.py to the\n    one in oslo-incubator.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idd059e3f4d00d91c9a14cf302fd780044929e3e5\n    Closes-bug: #1288877\n',15,0,'Ericsson'),(253859,1267,1714,'2014-03-14 15:26:45','2014-03-12 16:12:17','    Detect MultiDict when generating json body\n    \n    Detects webob.multidict Multidict at sanitizerand returns mixed()\n    out of them so they can be parsed as json.\n    \n    Fixes image-list when using Image API v2 with registry.\n    \n    Implements a test to verify that the /rpc endpoint exists as\n    intended.\n    \n    Closes bug: #1246980\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d28ca5d8f1af0ec7b9e7a8684e3160f674b8f4c\n',62,1,'HP'),(253861,1679,1679,'2014-03-20 15:37:05','2014-02-28 17:07:40','    Remove openstack.common.fixture\n    \n    This package is not used\n    \n    Change-Id: I9240ee4b1aa5934c6fc833e79ea32c53c6bc7569\n',0,132,'Mirantis'),(253862,818,818,'2014-03-19 20:04:29','2014-03-14 20:14:01','    VMware store.add to return the image size uploaded\n    \n    This patch fixes a tempest test failing for the VMware datastore.\n    When the size provided to add() is zero but the image size is actually\n    larger than zero, add() should return the size of the image uploaded\n    and not zero.\n    \n    Tempest failure:\n    api.image.v1.test_images.CreateRegisterImagesTest.test_register_then_upload\n    \n    Change-Id: I16524c0f25aa4124c24ca25ac014819267dd72c3\n    Closes-Bug: #1292764\n',42,4,'VMware'),(253864,65,65,'2014-03-17 18:06:10','2014-02-27 19:23:30','    registry: log errors on failure\n    \n    If an image fails to be updated/created/deleted/etc for whatever reason,\n    the registry server returns 500 – but there\'s no trace of the actual\n    error.

Store drivers are behind a private package called `_drivers` and\n    they\'re not suppose to be accessed directly. Instead, functions like\n    `get_store_from_scheme` should be used.\n    \n    4.

So this patch will make it\n    configurable firstly and set the default value as sha1 in\n    Kilo for smooth upgrade, which will be changed with sha256\n    in next release(L).\n    \n    DocImpact\n    UpgradeImapact\n    SecurityImpact\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1288545\n    \n    Change-Id: I9236cc85f4e9881ac1aa35d69bc6761a59c1b6c8\n',173,116,'Catalyst IT'),(254601,441,441,'2015-01-29 22:00:52','2015-01-29 22:00:52','    Updated from global requirements\n    \n    Change-Id: Iac8945ac561c78e70ec126f8c51267245fe29c79\n',6,6,NULL),(254602,1443,1443,'2015-01-30 12:31:30','2015-01-30 12:31:19','    Typos fixed in the comments\n    \n    Change-Id: I2930cd19631627cba6a195a74aff0e30d63fcb83\n',2,2,'Cisco Systems'),(254604,1711,1711,'2015-01-14 22:28:11','2014-12-16 03:00:41','    Fix copy-from when user_storage_quota is enabled\n    \n    If we enable \'user_storage_quota\' and try to upload image\n    then it throws \'AttributeError\' error.\n    \n    If \'user_storage_quota\' parameter is enabled then we need to send\n    image_data as LimitingReader class object to \'store_add_to_backend\'\n    method.

It is used when the\n    image is being copied from the remote source: some generator-based\n    image data representing the remote source acts as its underlying\n    object, and the instance of CooperativeReader is passed as a data\n    stream to the backend client which uses it to read the data.\n    \n    Before this patch, the CooperativeReader was ignoring the \"length\"\n    parameter of the read method, always returning the whole chunk returned\n    by the underlying generator (in case of HTTP source the size of this\n    chunk is 16 M). This was causing problems for the clients attempting to\n    read data from it, and - under some circumstances - the loss of data.\n    \n    For chunked storage of files in Swift a special class (ChunkReader,\n    declared in the swift store driver) is used to reduce the requested\n    read length so no extra data is read and transferred. However, this was\n    not working as the CooperativeReader (which was the underlying stream\n    for the ChunkReader) was ignoring the requested size. This was causing\n    the data to be lost when reading behind the boundaries of the Chunks.\n    \n    This patchset introduces a buffer in the CooperativeReader to store the\n    most recently fetched iterator chunk. The reads are independent from\n    requests to iterator, so the CooperativeReader is able to return the\n    exact requested amount of bytes and no data is lost due to extra-reads.\n    \n    SecurityImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ief37d1e29487bb03e612320f5cc06910cfd1c23a\n    Closes-bug: #1412802\n',99,7,'Mirantis'),(254623,5175,5175,'2015-01-21 17:32:41','2015-01-21 17:32:41','    Eliminate shell param from subprocesses in tests\n    \n    Of the calls to execute a subprocess performed in tests, none of them\n    require a shell.

Each config option has a type like strOpt,\n    BoolOpt, etc. StrOpt with parameter choices only allows values in set\n    of choices. In short word, each config option has limitation for type\n    and value. In production code, oslo.conf can ensure user\'s input is\n    valid, but in unit test, test methods can pass if we use method\n    CONF.set_override without parameter enforce_type=True even we pass wrong\n    type or wrong value to config option. This commit makes sure calling\n    method CONF.set_override with enforce_type=True,\n    \n    Note: We can\'t set enforce_type=True by default in oslo.config now, it\n    may break all project\'s unit test.

The\n    sample config files provided in tree (under etc/*) need to be updated\n    using the autogeneration tool as these files are being used in different\n    places.

This will result in a bad\n    experience for the user who is streaming the image data to Glance as\n    it is a better experiece to set the location after the image data has\n    been saved and image is in ``active`` status, in this case.\n    \n    If a custom location is set to an image in ``deactivated`` status, the\n    purpose of setting the image to ``deactivated`` is void. This will\n    result in a worse experience for the security team that is trying to\n    evaluate the validity of the image data of the deactivated image.\n    Avoiding setting custom location in this case will ensure data\n    consistency until image is pulled out of the deactivation process.\n    \n    This commit introduces the following change in behavior:\n      * If an image is in ``saving`` or ``deactivated`` status, the staus of\n        that image will be checked while trying to set the custom location\n        and a HTTP 409 Conflict status will be retured in response to the\n        user.\n      * If an image is in ``active`` or ``queued`` status, setting custom\n        locations on that image will be allowed so there is no change in\n        behavior for this case.\n      * If an image is in ``deleted`` or ``pending_delete`` status, a HTTP\n        409 Conflict status will be retured, if that image is visible to the\n        user (in case of admins). Otherwise, the location cannot be set\n        anyway. Setting a location to a ``deleted`` image is fruitless as\n        the image cannot be used. Please note ``pending_delete`` is another\n        form of the ``deleted`` status and behavior in either case should be\n        expected to be same.\n      * If an image is in ``killed`` status, a HTTP 409 Conflict status will\n        be retured. Nevertheless, it is again fruitless to attempt to set a\n        location on such images as they are unusable.\n      * This operation still involves the following race conditions:\n         * In case where the status of the image is ``saving`` and it\n           has just moved to ```active`` status, ideally setting custom\n           location should be allowed however, due to lack of atomicity in\n           setting image status glance will ignore setting the location and\n           a 409 will be returned.\n         * In case where the status of the image is ``deactivated`` and it\n           has just been moved to ``active`` status, ideally setting\n           custom location should be allowed however, due to lack of\n           atomicity in setting image status glance will ignore setting\n           the location and a 409 will be returned.\n         * In case where the status of the image is ``active`` and it has\n           just been moved to ``deactivated`` status, due to lack of\n           atomicity in setting image status, glance may set another\n           location on that image.\n         * In case where the status of the image is ``queued`` and it has\n           just been moved to ``saving`` status, due to lack of atomicity\n           in setting image status, glance may set another location on\n           that image.\n         * In case where the status of the image is ``queued`` or ``active``\n           and location is attempted to be set on it, if the image first\n           goes into ``deleted``, ``pending_delete`` or ``killed`` status\n           then the user will get a HTTP 409 Conflict status back. This\n           occurs again due to lack of atomicity in setting image status.\n    \n    Please note:\n      * We will plan to add further granularity in setting locations to the\n        images atomically in subsequent commits.\n      * Fow now, though, this commit does resolve the issue of setting\n        locations on an image incorrectly (in unexpected circumstances) to a\n        significant degree. So, this is good progress in ensuring rightful\n        use of the image locations feature.\n    \n    APIImpact\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Mike Fedosin <mfedosin@mirantis.com>\n    Co-Authored-By: Nikhil Komawar <nik.komawar@gmail.com>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie463e2f30db94cde7716c83a94ec2fb0c0658c91\n    Lite-Spec: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/324780/\n    Partial-Bug: 1587985\n',90,0,'Mirantis'),(578544,1721,1721,'2016-09-07 20:42:50','2016-08-31 20:45:22','    Fix nits from commit that introduces cursive\n    \n    Change I80fcafa528b87a83b90ed7c0e4c0db9228852bc2 has some nits that need\n    not be fixed right away.

Replacing of location\n        may be permitted here though.\n      * If an image is in ``deleted`` or ``pending_delete`` state, a HTTP\n        409 Conflict status will be returned, if that image is visible to\n        the user (in case of admins). Otherwise, the location cannot be\n        removed/replaced anyway.

Again, due\n        to lack of atomicity in setting image status glance will ignore\n        the request and a 409 will be returned.\n      * In case where the status of the image is ``active`` and it has\n        just been moved to ``deactivated`` status, due to lack of\n        atomicity in setting image status, glance may remove/replace\n        the location on that image.\n      * In case where the status of the image is ``queued`` and it has\n        just been moved to ``saving`` status, due to lack of atomicity\n        in setting image status, glance may replace the location for\n        that image.\n      * In case where the status of the image is ``active`` and location\n        is attempted to be set on it, and at that point if the image goes\n        into ``deleted``, ``pending_delete`` or ``killed`` status, then the\n        user must get a HTTP 409 Conflict status.
